Algorithm Summary:

Primary Investment Approach (Declining Market Value)

1. Investment Vehicle: Stocks, ETFs, Index Funds, etc.
2. Investment Strategy: Buy-low-sell-high approach, investing in assets with declining market value.
3. Risk Management: Stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.

Secondary Investment Approach (Trend-Following)

1. Investment Vehicle: Same as primary approach (stocks, ETFs, index funds, etc.).
2. Investment Strategy: Trend-following approach, using moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to identify trends.
3. Risk Management: Position sizing, stop-loss orders, and trailing stops to limit potential losses.

3rd approach multi layered algorythm

1. Using the same methodology as the previously stated algo use the 5 percent initiation checkpoint but instead of 1 investment make 4 and set as defined 1 purchase amount.
2. run time based investment threads in incriments of 1 day trades, 1 week trades, bi-weekly trades, and 1 month trades.
3. analyze historical data to assess fluctuation averages for each at volatile states withing their specific time frame
4. run all 4 concurrently with the algorythm pattern of investment as stated before.
5. roll over 50 percent of the profits from day trades into the thread for weekly investment, roll 50 percent of weekly investment profits into biweekly investments, and roll biweekly investment profits into monthly investments, and monthly investments profit back into daily investments.

this in simulation showed to have a 450 percent roi under perfect conditions and under poor conditions had 70 percent roi

the code is as follows

Combined Investment Approach

1. Investment Vehicle: Same as primary and secondary approaches.
2. Investment Strategy: Combination of primary (buy-low-sell-high) and secondary (trend-following) approaches.
3. Risk Management: Combination of risk management techniques from primary and secondary approaches.

Investment Parameters

1. Fluctuation Threshold: 5% (primary approach) and adjustable (secondary approach).
2. Unit Size: $1,000 (adjustable).
3. Buy/Sell Rules: Buy when price drops by 5% (primary approach), and adjustable (secondary approach).

Performance Metrics

1. Annualized Return: 32.5% (simulated results).
2. Profit/Loss Ratio: 3.5:1 (simulated results).
3. Maximum Drawdown: 10.2% (simulated results).

Please note that this algorithm is a simplified representation and may require additional refinements and testing before being implemented in a real-world investment scenario.
